## Indiana Jones \(Raiders of the Lost Ark\)

**Raiders of the Lost Ark** \(also known as **Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark**\) is a 1981 American action adventure fantasy film directed by [Steven Spielberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg). It was written by [Lawrence Kasdan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kasdan) from a story by  [George Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas) and [Philip Kaufman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kaufman).

The first installment in the Indiana Jones film franchise, it stars [Harrison Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford) as archaeologist Indiana Jones, who battles a group of Nazis searching for the Ark of the Covenant. It co-stars [Karen Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Allen) as Indiana's former lover, [Marion Ravenwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood); [Paul Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Freeman_%28actor%29) as Indiana's rival, French archaeologist [René Belloq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Ren%C3%A9_Belloq); [John Rhys-Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rhys-Davies) as Indiana's sidekick, [Sallah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallah); [Ronald Lacey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Lacey) as [Gestapo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo) agent [Arnold Toht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Toht); and [Denholm Elliott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denholm_Elliott) as Indiana's colleague, [Marcus Brody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Brody).

The film originated from Lucas' desire to create a modern version of the serials of the 1930s and 1940s. Production was based at [Elstree Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elstree_Studios), England, but filming also took place in [La Rochelle, France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rochelle,_France), [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisia), [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii), and [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) from June to September 1980.

Raiders of the Lost Ark became 1981's top-grossing film and remains one of the highest-grossing films adjusted for inflation. It was nominated for eight [Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards) in [1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/54th_Academy_Awards), including [Best Picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture), and won for Best Art Direction, Film Editing, Sound, and Visual Effects with a fifth Academy Award: a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing. It is often considered one of the greatest films ever made. In 1999, it was included in the U.S. Library of Congress' National Film Registry as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The film began a franchise including a prequel, two sequels, a television series, [The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Indiana_Jones_Chronicles)\(1992–1996\), and numerous video games.
